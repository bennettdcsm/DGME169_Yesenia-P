        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          During my time in the Beachy Lab at Stanford, I developed a custom
          Python tool to quantify CGRP-positive neurites in mouse bladder
          tissue. The goal was to support experiments investigating how
          estrogen affects bladder sensory innervation and urothelial
          homeostasis, which is relevant to chronic pelvic pain conditions such
          as Interstitial Cystitis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tool automated a process that was previously done manually,
          helping researchers analyze images faster, reduce human error, and
          compare nerve density across multiple samples in a consistent way.
        </p>

        <h2>Scientific Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The Neurite Tracing Tool was designed to answer three main questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does sensory innervation change with age or sex?</li>
          <li>Does endogenous estrogen influence bladder nerve density?</li>
          <li>
            Does supplemental estradiol affect sensory nerve density or
            urothelial organoid growth?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To support these experiments, the tool needed to reliably identify
          CGRP-labeled neurites, estimate their total length, and output a
          numeric value that could be compared between age groups, sexes, and
          hormone conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>How the Tool Works</h2>
        <h3>1. Image Preprocessing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert fluorescence images to grayscale.</li>
          <li>Apply Gaussian smoothing to reduce noise.</li>
          <li>Adjust contrast to make neurites easier to detect.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Neurite Detection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use thresholding to isolate bright CGRP-positive signal.</li>
          <li>Apply morphological operations to clean up small artifacts.</li>
          <li>Remove background noise and non-neurite regions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Length Estimation</h3>
        <p>
          Once neurites are isolated, the tool estimates total neurite length by
          counting the number of “green” pixels and dividing by an estimated
          average neurite width:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Total neurite length ≈ green pixel count ÷ neurite width</strong></p>
        <p>
          This method matched the measurements used in the rest of the project
          and produced values that were consistent with manual neurite
          tracing by hand.
        </p>

        <h2>Research Findings Supported by the Tool</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Sex and age differences:</strong> Female bladders tended to
            have higher sensory innervation than male bladders, and nerve
            density increased with age (P50 &gt; P7).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Estrogen supplementation:</strong> Estradiol did not
            consistently increase sensory nerve density; in some cases high
            levels of estrogen appeared to impair nerve growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organoid experiments:</strong> In separate assays, estrogen
            dose affected the size and number of urothelial organoids, which
            were quantified alongside neurite measurements.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The neurite length measurements from this tool were used directly in
          plots comparing age, sex, and hormone conditions across the study.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <ul class="pill-list">
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>OpenCV</li>
          <li>NumPy / SciPy</li>
          <li>Image Processing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
          This project resulted in a working, lab-tested tool for automated
          neurite quantification. It allowed the team to process many more
          images than would have been feasible by hand and became the
          foundation for my later, more advanced Fine-Tune Cell Annotation
          Tool.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>More accurate estimation of neurite width and branching.</li>
          <li>Automatic reconnection of broken neurite segments.</li>
          <li>Support for 3D or z-stack fluorescence images.</li>
          <li>
            A simple UI so that non-programmers in the lab can run the tool
            without editing code.
          </li>
        </ul>
